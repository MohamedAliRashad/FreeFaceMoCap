The idea of the project came when we were discussing the future of **Motion Capture** and how centralized its solution is.

A lot of animators in todays world don't have the tools that enable them to build high-quality animations for their audience or themselves.

```python
def story():
    pass
```

**Mediapipe** is a great solution
